# Launching Visual Studio Code from the command line on macOS

You can launch VS Code from the command line by typing `code` within the directory you would like to open.

This will open the current directory within VS Code, with the files ready to edit.

To allow this, the following actions will need to be taken within VS Code:

*  Open the Command Palette `⇧⌘P` and type **shell command** to find **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH** command.
*  Restart the terminal
